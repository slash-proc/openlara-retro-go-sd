# What the page reads: the version index that build_dist.py mirrors into this
# same site. The page offers every version the mirror holds, defaults to the
# newest, and a new release therefore reaches users without redeploying this
# page. Each version's manifest is the identical file a third-party installer
# fetches, and the module and every other file the manifest names resolve
# beside it.
#
# Release assets cannot be used directly: they are not CORS-fetchable, which is
# the reason the mirror exists (the spec's spec/01-distribution.md).
#
# DIST_DIR names an already-mirrored dist to copy in, which is what CI passes.
# With nothing to copy, a preview dist is generated from the local module so
# that the assembled site is testable at all -- see make-preview-dist.mjs for
# why that is not a second source of truth.
